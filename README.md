# Deep Learning

## Hello!
My name is Joseph Bergman. I am a senior at the University of Maryland majoring in computer science and finance and minoring in mathematics. This semester (Fall 2018) I am studying abroad at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I am a business major at Yonsei, so I am taking a marketing class, a macroeconomics class, and a Korean language class. In addition to my Yonsei classes, I have arranged to independently study deep learning ([CMSC 498A](http://undergrad.cs.umd.edu/independent-study-cmsc498a)) through UMD while abroad. My independent study advisor is [Professor John Dickerson](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dickerson).

## The Blog
This blog is the "deliverable" for my independent study. Each month, I will complete a deep learning project based on what I have been learning. Blog posts will be written as project-based tutorials so that a reader could easily follow along to reproduce the projects -- and hopefully learn something about deep learning in the process. Data, source code, and even this blog can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JosephBergman/deep-learning).

## Resources
I used the following resources for learning and inspiration.
+ [Coursera: Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
+ [Fast AI: Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/)
+ [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

## Datasets
My blog posts make use of the following datasets.
+ TBD!

## About This Site 
+ This blog was made with Jekyll using the [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/) theme
+ The blog can be found on the `gh-pages` branch
