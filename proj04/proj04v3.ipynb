    "## Introduction \n",
    "Autograd is a library capable of automatically differentiating native Python and Numpy code. It is capable of handling loops, ifs, recursion, and closures. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (used by TensorFlow). Its primary purpose is gradient-based optimization â€“ which happens to be how we train neural networks. Today, we will look at creating a neural network from scratch, and we will use Autograd to assist us in implementing backpropagation. "
